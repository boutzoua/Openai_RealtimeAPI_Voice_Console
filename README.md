# OpenAI Realtime Console

The OpenAI Realtime Console is intended as an inspector and interactive API reference
for the OpenAI Realtime API. It comes packaged with two utility libraries,
[openai/openai-realtime-api-beta](https://github.com/openai/openai-realtime-api-beta)
that acts as a **Reference Client** (for browser and Node.js) and
[`/src/lib/wavtools`](./src/lib/wavtools) which allows for simple audio
management in the browser.


# Using the console

The console requires an OpenAI API key (**user key** or **project key**) that has access to the
Realtime API. You'll be prompted on startup to enter it. It will be saved via `localStorage` and can be
changed at any time from the UI.

To start a session you'll need to **connect**. This will require microphone access.
You can then choose between **manual** (Push-to-talk) and **vad** (Voice Activity Detection)
conversation modes, and switch between them at any time.

## Using a relay server

If you would like to build a more robust implementation and play around with the reference
client using your own server, we have included a Node.js [Relay Server](/relay-server/index.js).

```shell
$ npm run relay
```

It will start automatically on `localhost:8081`.

**You will need to create a `.env` file** with the following configuration:

```conf
OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
REACT_APP_LOCAL_RELAY_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8081
```

You will need to restart both your React app and relay server for the `.env.` changes
to take effect. The local server URL is loaded via [`ConsolePage.tsx`](/src/pages/ConsolePage.tsx).
To stop using the relay server at any time, simply delete the environment
variable or set it to empty string.


## Interrupting the model

You may want to manually interrupt the model, especially in `turn_detection: 'disabled'` mode.
To do this, we can use:

```javascript
// id is the id of the item currently being generated
// sampleCount is the number of audio samples that have been heard by the listener
client.cancelResponse(id, sampleCount);
```

This method will cause the model to immediately cease generation, but also truncate the
item being played by removing all audio after `sampleCount` and clearing the text
response. By using this method you can interrupt the model and prevent it from "remembering"
anything it has generated that is ahead of where the user's state is.
